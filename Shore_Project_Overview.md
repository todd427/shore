# Shore Project Overview

## Project Summary

**Shore** is a Django-based *author publishing platform*—a foundational scaffolding project designed to develop and test all the features required for modern self-publishing. It serves as a central development sandbox, with the intention of splitting off specialized projects as individual components mature. The ultimate goal is to empower authors with a robust, integrated self-publishing ecosystem.
